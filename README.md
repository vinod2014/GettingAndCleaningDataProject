R script called run_analysis.R is created that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
    
## Project Steps
- Download the data https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
- Extract the data archive in a directory.
- Open R Studio and set working directory to "UCI HAR Dataset" directory which is extracted from the dataset.
- source run_analysis.R script which will produce summary_result.txt file.
- Refer to more details about how the summary_result.txt is created in accompanying CodeBook.md
